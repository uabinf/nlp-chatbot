A language-teaching chatbot designed by Andrew and Alyssa for the CS462 NLP Group Project.

# Running Instructions #
1. Navigate into project directory with `cd nlp_project`
2. Start up an interactive job so that your process doesn't run on the login node with `./run`
    * You will be warned if you are already running a job. You can display your jobs with `./list`
3. Setup your Jupyter enviroment so we have access to NLTK libraries. This cannot be done from a script so manually copy all of the commands from `conda`
4. Run the program with `python main.py` and you will be interacting with the bot.
5. When finished, run `./quit` to clean up your interactive job.
